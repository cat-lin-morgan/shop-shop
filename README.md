## Description

MERN Application that uses Redux and GraphQL to manage state and fetch data from MongoDB.

Refactored from React Context API to use Redux, application retains all of it's original functionality.

It did not require sweeping changes. I changed the way my reducer worked, and how my App.js and several components depended on state.

**To Note:** I left the Global Context API code commented out in the files. I wanted to still be able to see and refernece the work I did with the React Context API.

## Technology Used

I used two npms, ['react-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux) && ['redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux).

I used ```createStore``` from the _redux package_ and the _hooks_ ```useDispatch``` and ```useSelector``` from the _react-redux package_.

Below are screenshots of their usage.
