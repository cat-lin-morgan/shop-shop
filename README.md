## Description

MERN Application that uses Redux and GraphQL to manage state and fetch data from MongoDB.

Refactored from React Context API to use Redux, application retains all of it's original functionality.

**To Note:** I left the Global Context API code commented out in the files. I wanted to still be able to see and refernece the work I did with the API.
